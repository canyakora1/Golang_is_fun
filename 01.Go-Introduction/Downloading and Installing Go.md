## Introduction

[Go](https://go.dev/)Â is a programming language that was born out of frustration. At Google, developers were tired of having to make tradeoffs when picking the language for a new project. Some languages executed efficiently but took a long time to compile, while others were easy to write but ran inefficiently in production. So Google invented Go and designed the language to have it all: fast compilation, fast execution, easy to write, and easy to deploy.

While Go is a versatile language that can be used for many kinds of projects, from web applications to command-line tools, it is particularly well suited for distributed systems and microservice architectures, earning it a reputation as the language of the cloud. It helps the modern programmer do more with a strong set of tooling, removing debates over formatting by making the format part of the language specification, as well as making deployment easy by compiling each program and all of its dependencies into a single binary. Go is easy to learn, with a very small set of keywords, which makes it a great choice for beginner and veteran developers alike.

In this introductory tutorial, you will install Go on your local macOS machine and run your first program to prove that the installation worked.
